# movie_fight
the movie fight page has heading on top
page has two inputs for users to input a movie name
both inputs have auto complete functionality
once inputs are entered, user can select the movie they want
information about the movie shows up
between the two movies, which ever has higher values is highlighted accordingly
big challenges in this project:
- need to fetch data about movies (use omdbapi.com)
we will be making two different request
one to search the title of the movie
second to get all the information about a specific movie
- decide how the autocomplete widget will work
- style the project better with css
